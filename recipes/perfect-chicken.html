                <li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
                <li>½ cup cornstarch, or as needed</li>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>
                    Pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic; bring to a boil and cook at a boil until the liquid
                    reduces by half, about 10 minutes. Pour in the white wine, return to a boil, and reduce the liquid by half again, about
                    10 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, rosemary, and sage; simmer until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice,
                    about 15 more minutes. Stir in cream, butter, lemon, and capers; reduce heat and simmer the sauce until thickened, about
                    10 minutes (45 minutes in all).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the cornstarch on all sides until thoroughly
                    coated. Shake off excess cornstarch. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; pan-fry the chicken thighs until
                    they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place the chicken thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and
                    pour the sauce over the chicken.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 15
                    minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chicken thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74
                    degrees C).
